<h1>Code challenge</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project contains three parts:

<h4>1. Student Grade Generator</h4>
Student code generator prompts the user to input their marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the grade according to the following conditions: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

<h4>2. Speed Detector</h4>
Speed of a car e.g 80 is taken as input. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it prints: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: “License suspended”.

<h4>3. Net Salary Calculator</h4>
Here, an individual’s Net Salary is calculated by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary according to the values from https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm
